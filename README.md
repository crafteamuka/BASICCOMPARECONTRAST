JUST STARTED LEARNING PYTHON
THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE BUT CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON THE BASICS
MAYBE SHOW WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED, MAYBE  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2ND ADDITION:
I HAVE ADDED A SPEEL CHECKER BUT NOT YET COMBINED IT WITH THE COMPARE-AND-CONTRAST
ITS JUST TO CHECK THE SPELLING OF A WORD
ALL FEEDBACK IS WELCOME

ENJOY :)
