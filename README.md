JUST STARTED LEARNING PYTHON
THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE BUT CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON THE BASICS
MAYBE SHOW WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED, MAYBE  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2ND ADDITION:
I HAVE ADDED A SPEEL CHECKER BUT NOT YET COMBINED IT WITH THE COMPARE-AND-CONTRAST
ITS JUST TO CHECK THE SPELLING OF A WORD
ALL FEEDBACK IS WELCOME

3RD (19/07/2024):
USED MATERIAL FROM 
How to Write a Spelling Corrector. (n.d.). https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html
TO IMPROVE MY SPELLCHECKER
STILL FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE PROCESSING TIMES
AND ADDING MORE WORDS

ENJOY :)
